                        <p id="aboutme1">Welcome to my website. I’m Mindy—a professional writer whose work has appeared in newspapers and magazines and on television. In 2008 I walked away from my full-time job and corner office to pursue my long-time dream of freelancing. I have been going strong ever since. In 2010 I formed Mindy Long Freelance LLC. I bring over 15 years of writing experience to the table and will gladly write about any subject. My eclectic portfolio reflects my ability to quickly master nearly any subject.</p>

                        <p id="aboutme2">Feel free to browse my site, read my work and learn more about my experience. Moreover, take a look at what some of my clients have to say. I am proud of the work I do and I would love to work with you on your next project. Let’s chat.</p>
